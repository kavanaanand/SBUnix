Warmup-Part 1:
The shell 'SBUsh' supported the following commands:
  
1. Shell Support for cd
2. Shell support for executing binaries using absolute path
3. Shell support for executing scripts using absolute path
4. Shell support for multi-pipelining using absolute path
5. Shell support for setting PS1
6. Implementation of the functionality used by our shell 
7. Implementation of the functions declared in stdlib.h
8. Implmentation of printf()
9. Implementation of scanf()


What we were unable to implement - 
1. Passing arguments to main() by bringing argc, argv and envp from stack.
2. Shell support for setting PATH and shell support for relative paths because we were unable to get and loop through char **envp[] in our shell program

malloc() and free() implementation:
The entire idea behind implementation of malloc was taken from here. The idea given on the website is a complex malloc implementation,
we implemented a simpler version of it.
